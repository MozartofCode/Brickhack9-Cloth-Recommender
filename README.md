PROJECT NAME

"Your Recommender" 

INTRODUCTION

This was a project that was developed for BrickHack 9 at Rochester Institute of Technology by Bertan Berker, Sean Gilday, John Skorcik and Gavin Mcllvaine.

The purpose of the project was to create an MVP that would satisfy the requirements of the constellation brand challenge, which is:

 Constellation Brands - Elevating with AI
Our hackathon challenge invites you to use AI to improve the human experience. Utilize existing services (ex., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Tensorflow),
develop your own intelligent system, or create mockups of AI responses to bring your ideas to life. We want you to showcase how AI can elevate human abilities
rather than replace them. Consider how AI could enhance your creative work by streamlining everyday tasks. Take inspiration from existing technologies and think about
the potential for AI integration. Let your imagination run wild, and consider how AI could improve your life and work. Let's work together to revolutionize the future
of productivity â€“ we can't wait to see what you come up with! Each member of the winning team will receive a $150 Amazon gift card.

We created a web-application using Tensorflow that gives clothing recommendations to users based on what clothes they have in their wardrobe.

We utilized MySQL as our relational database, node.js (express.js framework) as our backend, python to handle our image processing functions and lastly we used
reactJS for our frontend for our web application.

FEATURES

1- Adding clothes to your wardrobe
2- Image processing that detects the color and type of your cloth
3- Our recommendation algorithm that gives you the best recommendations on what to match
